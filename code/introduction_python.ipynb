More concretely, it will offer some basic code for (i) manipulating tabular data frames; and (ii) visualizing descriptive statistics or other quantities of interest. However, this notebook **will not** provide an exhaustive overview of the affordances of `Python` for research in the social and behavioural sciences, nor will it get into the weeds of [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) or other machine learning libraries that `Python` is known for (fear not: we'll delve into machine learning in a few short months).\n"
